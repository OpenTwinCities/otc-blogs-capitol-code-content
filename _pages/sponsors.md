Fundamental to this commitment is the role we serve as a responsible global corporate citizen. As our company has grown, this commitment has extended far beyond our own products and services and has been amplified many times over through our network of partners, including governments, nonprofits and other organizations. <a title="ESRI" href="http://www.esri.com/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-131" alt="ESRI" src="http://capitolcode.mn.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/esri-logo-300x134.jpg" width="300" height="134" /></a>Esri is an exciting company doing important work. Our technology enables organizations to create responsible and sustainable solutions to problems at local and global scales.

Our mission is to harness the power of online tools to support participation in public life, strengthen communities, and build democracy. Starting with the world's first election information website in [1994][1] in Minnesota, today we host over 50 local [Issues Forums][2] in 17 communities across three countries - New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In addition to these "online town halls" and our "community life" forums we [promote civic engagement online][3] around the world. [<img class="wp-image-68 alignleft" alt="JOIA All Natural Soda" src="http://capitolcode.mn.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/JOIA-all-natural-soda-logo-300x194.jpg" width="200" height="129" />][4]JOIA started over a dinner with great friends. After years of creating his own sparkling drink concoctions, Bob, our founder, observed all of the interesting cocktail combinations of fruits, herbs and spices that were being offered and the question arose: why isn’t anyone doing something this interesting with sodas? <a href="https://www.cardboardit.com/" target="_blank"><img class="size-medium wp-image-69 alignleft" alt="Cardboard by DevJam Studios" src="http://capitolcode.mn.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/CardBoard_Logo-300x76.png" width="300" height="76" /></a> Cardboard is a collaborative tool for creating and using [Story Maps][5]. It is a virtual home for teams that like to organize by story maps, but can't always share the same wall. Think of Cardboard as your virtual home for those sticky notes. [<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-112" alt="Five Friends Food" src="http://capitolcode.mn.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/FiveFriends-Logo-BW.png" width="300" height="137" />][6] Fresh Bar was created by a pair of Minnesota twins, Will Handke and Ross Pomeroy (yes, different last names), who share a huge passion for healthy eating. In 2011, they began to wonder why there were so few good nutrition bars to choose from and why they all had to be served dry and come loaded with tasteless preservatives. Will and Ross were upset, but instead of throwing their hands up in disgust, they threw on their oven mitts and got to work. The result of their effort is Fresh Bar. Will and Ross’s goal was to make a bar with natural, whole ingredients, that tastes great, is healthy, and maintains its straight-out-of-the-oven texture. They believe that Fresh Bar has accomplished this goal and they’d love for you to give them a chance to prove it! In 2012, Will and Ross were joined by three of their childhood friends, Austin Hinkle, Mike Steffan and Tom Johnson. [<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-113" alt="EcoStatic Inc." src="http://capitolcode.mn.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Copy-of-EcostaticInc.png" width="295" height="92" />][7]EcoStatic Inc is the maker of Slicky Notes and Slicky Boards, environmentally sustainable writing surfaces that use static electricity instead of adhesive to stick to walls and surfaces. In addition to our unique products, we are committed to three primary dimensions of sustainability—social, environmental and economic. <a href="http://www.cocoamourfoods.com/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-142" alt="Coco-Amour" src="http://capitolcode.mn.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/CoCo-Amour-300x198.png" width="300" height="198" /></a>   We started with the goal of creating a macaroon that was both healthy and delicious. We think that we have done just that! All of our macaroons begin with the finest ingredients~~healthy, organic and locally sourced. Our Maple Syrup is sourced from a grove of over 3400 maples in Aitkin County Minnesota. Many of our other ingredients are sourced from a single Minnesota distributor. With these fine ingredients we tested and tried many recipe variations and believe that we have created something quite unique and delicious--crisp on the outside and slightly soft in the middle. We preserve our macaroons naturally through low temperature dehydration leaving them a RAW and healthy food.

Communities determine issues important to them, and provide an understanding of the context of these issues and the wisdom to shape how they can best be addressed to create vital places to live and work. The university contributes extensive knowledge and expertise to understand community issues and discover new approaches to address them. This model of engaged research leads to outcomes that strengthen the community and enrich academic research. <a title="United States Census" href="http://www.census.gov/" target="_blank"><img class="size-medium wp-image-64 alignleft" style="line-height: 1.5em;" alt="United States Census" src="http://capitolcode.mn.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/future-on-logo-activating-change-300x58.png" width="300" height="58" /></a> The Census Bureau's mission is to serve as the leading source of quality data about the nation's people and economy.
