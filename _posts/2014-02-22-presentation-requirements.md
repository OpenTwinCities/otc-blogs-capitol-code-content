Teams that have worked together during Capitol Code will be asked to make a short presentation (3 minutes, plus 2 for questions) at the end of the event so that all participants and the public will get a chance to see what everybody worked on. This presentation should consist of no more than five slides or pages that illustrates or describes: 
*   the **problem** being solved;
*   the **solution** being proposed;
*   the **work** your team completed;
*   the **data** being used and how itâ€™s being used;
*   and **short bios** for each of your team members. If you have something you would like to demo, feel free to do that as well in your three minutes.
